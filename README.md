# Module_Eight_Challenge_Movies_ETL

## Project Overview
To create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Refactor the code from module eight to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
- Deliverables
 1. Write an ETL funciton to read three data files.
 2. Extract and transform the Wikipedia data.
 3. Extract and transform the Kaggle data.
 4. Create the Movie Database
